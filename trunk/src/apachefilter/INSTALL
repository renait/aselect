Quick Installation instructions
-------------------------------

If you run into any problems, please visit the A-Select
website at http://aselect.surfnet.nl/ for more information.

1. Install the filter module

You need Apache 1.3 or 2.0 with DSO support. The supplied
"install.sh" script is able to compile and install the filter
module for both Apache versions.

Note: the script needs apxs to compile the filter!

For Apache 1.3: run "./install.sh apache13"
For Apache 2.0: run "./install.sh apache20"

2. Copy the error template

Copy conf/error_template.html to a suitable location. The
template is loaded by the filter module at startup - it's
not served directly by Apache. Therefore, it does not have
to reside below your Apache document root. It must however
be readable by the Apache user.

3. Copy the aselectres directory
Copy the aselectres directory, which contains some necessary images
for the A-Select templates, to your Apache document root. Ensure that 
the files are readable by the Apache user.

4. Configure the filter

A sample configuration is provided in conf/aselect_filter_sample.conf.
Copy this file to your Apache config directory and modify
it to suit your needs. Don't forget to Include it in your
main Apache configuration file (typically httpd.conf). 
Alternatively, you can copy the contents of the configuration
file directly into httpd.conf.

5. Test it

Start or restart Apache. If the filter was installed and
configured correctly, you should not see any messages and
Apache should start succesfully. Otherwise you'll see an
error message during Apache startup. The filter module also
logs to the Apache error log.
